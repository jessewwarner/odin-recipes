            <li>1-inch piece of ginger, grated</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>

            <li>Sliced green onions (for garnish)</li>
            <li>Sesame seeds (for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the Sunny Side Up Eggs:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the Broccoli, Sausage, and Peppers:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup broccoli florets</li>
            <li>2 sausages of your choice (e.g., pork, chicken, or vegetarian), sliced into rounds</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 yellow bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h4>Preparing the Ramen:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, heat vegetable oil over medium heat. Add minced garlic and grated ginger, sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Bring the broth to a simmer and let it cook for about 10 minutes to develop flavor.</li>
            <li>While the broth simmers, cook the ramen noodles separately according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Cooking the Sunny Side Up Eggs:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a non-stick skillet, melt butter over medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>Crack the eggs into the skillet, being careful not to break the yolks. Season each egg with a pinch of salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook the eggs until the whites are set but the yolks remain runny, about 2-3 minutes. You can cover the skillet with a lid for even cooking, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Preparing the Broccoli, Sausage, and Peppers:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a separate skillet, heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add the sausage rounds and cook until they are browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet, add the sliced red and yellow bell peppers. Sauté for 3-4 minutes until they begin to soften.</li>
            <li>Add the broccoli florets to the skillet and continue to sauté for an additional 3-4 minutes until the vegetables are tender-crisp.</li>
            <li>Season the vegetables and sausage with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Assembling the Ramen:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Divide the cooked ramen noodles among serving bowls.</li>
            <li>Ladle the hot broth over the noodles.</li>
            <li>Arrange the cooked sausage, sautéed broccoli, and bell peppers on top.</li>
            <li>Carefully slide a sunny side up egg onto each bowl, placing it on top of the noodles.</li>
            <li>Garnish with sliced green onions and a sprinkle of sesame seeds.</li>
        </ol>
