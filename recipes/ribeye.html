    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Preparing the Ribeye:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Remove the ribeye steaks from the refrigerator and let them come to room temperature for about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat your grill or a heavy skillet over high heat. Brush the steaks with olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the steaks on the hot grill or skillet and sear for 4-5 minutes on each side for medium-rare, adjusting the time for your preferred level of doneness.
        </li>
        <li>
            During the last minute of cooking, add minced garlic and fresh rosemary to the skillet, allowing the flavors to infuse.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the cooked steaks to a cutting board, cover with foil, and let them rest for 5 minutes before slicing.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Making the Garlic Mashed Potatoes:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            While the steaks are resting, place the peeled and cubed potatoes in a large pot of salted boiling water. Cook until tender, approximately 15-20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot. Add minced garlic, heavy cream, and butter. Mash the potatoes until smooth and creamy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season with salt and white pepper to taste. Keep warm until serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Roasting the Asparagus:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the trimmed asparagus spears on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt, black pepper, and lemon zest. Toss to coat evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roast in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the asparagus is tender and slightly crispy at the tips.
        </li>
        <li>
            Optionally, sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese over the roasted asparagus before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Plating:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Arrange a generous scoop of garlic mashed potatoes on each plate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fan out slices of the succulent ribeye steak beside the potatoes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add a portion of roasted asparagus spears.
        </li>
        <li>
            Garnish the mashed potatoes with chopped fresh chives for a burst of color and freshness.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve immediately and savor the symphony of flavors in every bite.
