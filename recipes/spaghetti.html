        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>

        <li>12 ounces spaghetti</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves, for garnish</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Making the Meatballs:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine ground beef, ground pork, breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, chopped parsley, milk, egg, minced garlic, salt, black pepper, dried oregano, and dried basil.</li>
        <li>Mix the ingredients together until well combined, but avoid overmixing to keep the meatballs tender.</li>
        <li>Form the mixture into meatballs, about 1.5 inches in diameter. You should get around 20 meatballs.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs and cook until they're browned on all sides and cooked through, about 8-10 minutes. Remove from the skillet and set aside.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Preparing the Tomato Sauce:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In the same skillet used for the meatballs, add chopped onion and minced garlic. Saut√© over medium heat until the onion becomes translucent, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, dried basil, dried oregano, sugar, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes if using. Stir well to combine.</li>
        <li>Return the cooked meatballs to the skillet, ensuring they are submerged in the sauce.</li>
        <li>Simmer the sauce and meatballs for 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together and the meatballs to soak up the sauce.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cooking the Spaghetti:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>While the sauce simmers, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente.</li>
        <li>Drain the spaghetti and set aside.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Plating:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>To serve, place a portion of cooked spaghetti on each plate.</li>
        <li>Ladle the rich tomato sauce and meatballs over the spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves and a generous sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Serve piping hot, and enjoy the comforting embrace of this "Classic Spaghetti with Homemade Meatballs and Rich Tomato Sauce."</li>
