# odin-recipes
Recipe website project for The Odin Project.

This project is to create a recipe website. The site will have a main page with three links to recipes. The recipe pages will consists of images, headings, and paragraphs, which show what the finished dish should look like and explain how to make it.

The project demonstrates the ability to use basic git functionality and HTML. The necessary git skills are cloning repositories, staging changes, and commiting staged changes. The necessary HTML skills are creating the boiler plate code and using basic HTML tags to create links, display text, and display images. This project also demostrates basic computer skills by creating directories to separate the main page from the recipes.
